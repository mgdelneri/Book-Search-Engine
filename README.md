# Book Search Engine

## GOAL 

The goal of this assignment was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

## PROCESS

The instructions for this assignment were very helpful, as they outlined the places in the starter code that needed refactoring. After studying the starter code, I looked over those specific sections closely, and referred back to the class activities that were related to these sections. I also did some research online on the side, looking at different ways that people explain the process of going from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API. 

Because each part of the code depends on one another, it was hard to fully test the functionality of the app along the way, but after I felt like I had tried to refactor all of the necessary portions of the code, I ran the app several times and fixed bugs along the way. In some ways, this is the part of the process that takes the longest, because it requires carefully reading through the code until a possible error pops out. To a new coder, this can be quite frustrating and extensive, but is also great practice. In the end, it all seemed to work well. 

The last part of the process was to deploy the Book Search Engine application to Heroku, with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
